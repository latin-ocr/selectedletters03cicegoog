INTRODUCTION. lxxv

by which Cicero commonly introduces proverbial expres·
sions and popular sayings in formal composition. In-
stances of popular expressions are duo pari'ctcs dc cadcm‘
fidelia dealbare (Curius,v Fam. 7. 29. 2); sus nicoenam
[docet] (Fam. 9. 18. 3) ;pictus et politus (Act. 2. 21. 4);
sciens prudensque (Cael, Fam. 8. 16. 5).

103. Play upon Words, etc. In the same connection men-
tion may be made of the fondness which Cicero and some
of his correspondents show for playing upon words in their
familiar letters Illustrations are tu istic to Hateriano iure
[jurisprudence] delectas, ego me ln'c Hirtiano [iura ‘sauce ’]
(Fam. 9. 18. 3) ; tu, qni ceteris caaerc didicisti, in Britannia ne
ab essedariis decipiaris caveto, ‘you who have learned how to
draw up securities for others, look out for your own security
-and don't be taken in by the essedarii' (Fam. 7. 6. 2).
Cicero’s letters tobis legal friend Trebatius (Fam. Bk. 7)
are full of legal puns. Other good instances of similar witti-
cisms are to be found in An. 1.16. 10 and in the letters
to Paetus (Fam. Bk. 9). Cf. also notes to honoris cansa,
Epist. XIX. 2, and occidione occisum, XXXIV. 7. Cicero
had a great reputation for wit of this sort (cf. Fam. 9. 16. 4),
and after his death his secretary Tiro edited his witty say-
ings. Cf. Quint. 6. 3. 5 ; Macrob. Sat. 2. 1. 12.

104. In conclusion it may be noted that in his discussion
of public and private affairs of a delicate character, Cicero
often considered it discreet to express himself in language
which would be unintelligible to every one save the person
for whom the letter in question was intended. As he him-
self puts it in one case : sed lcacc scripsi properans ct melicr-
cule timide ,· posthac ad te ant, si perfidelem habebo cui dem,
scribam plane omnia aut, si obscure scribam, tn tamen intelle-
ges ,¹ in iis epistulis me Laelium, te F ccrc'nm faciam 3 cctcra crunt
ἐν αἰνιγμοῖς (Act. 2. 19. 5). As a result of this policy there
are some puzzling passages in the Letters which still frus·
