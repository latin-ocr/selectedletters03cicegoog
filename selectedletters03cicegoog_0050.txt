Cicero did not apparently increase his property to any great
extent by productive investments A large part of it in fact
was invested in houses and villas in Rome and in the country
districts of Italy. Besides his town house upon the Palatino,
which he bought of M. Crassus in 62 nc. for 3,5oo,ooo
sesterces,¹ Cicero owned villas at Arpinum, Tusculum,
Antium, Astura, Formiae, Cumae, Puteoli, and Pompeii, and
lodges along some of the more frequented Italian roads.
Large sums of money were spent in decorating and furnish·
ing these different residences² and upon their proper
· maintenance. When, in addition to these heavy expenses,

we bear in mind his great fondness for works of art and
literature,⁸ his generous mode of living, his openhauded·
ness to friends and clients, and his. social ambition for
his son and daughter,⁴ it is evident that even the enorm-
ous sums stated would be scarcely sufficient to meet his
needs.

46. Iu fact Cicero was 'frequently in great financial
difficulty, and was relieved only by loans made to him by
his friend Atticus, or by P.Su11a‚⁵ or still worse by his
political enemy Caesar⁶ or by the money-lenders at Rome.
With skilful management probably his fortune would have
been sufficient to meet the demands made upon it, buthe
was so much engrossed in politics, literature, and the prac-
tice of his profession that he had little time or inclination
for business affairs. Then‚ too, during his exile and during
· his absence at the outbreak of the civil war, his finances
were wretchedly muddled by Terentia and her untrustworthy
steward Philotimus!
