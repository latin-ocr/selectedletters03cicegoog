CICERO’S LETTERS.

inopiam esse clamarent, cum per eos dies senatus de
annona haberetur et ad eius procurationem sermone
non solum plebis, verum etiam bonorum Pompeius
vocaretur, idque ipse cuperet multitudoque ame nomi-
natim ut id decernerem postularet, ieci et accurate
sententiam dixi, cum abessent consulares quod tuto se
negarent posse sententiam dicere, praeter Messallam

result did not follow, there was a
popular reaction against him, led
by Clodius—id ipse (sc. Pem-
peius) cuperet: in the latter part
oi 58 iac. Pompey and Clodius
had a violent quarrel, and were
still at enmity with each other.
Atticus might therefore have sup·
posed that the position, which was
to be offered to Pompey, since
it was the result oi the agitation
led by Clodius, was distasteful to
Pompey—ut id decernerem,
that J should advocate that course.
—quod . . . dicere: Cicero com·
ments bitterly upon the cowardice
of the Optimates in an oration
delivered a short time aiter this:
atenim non nulli prepter timorem,
quod se in senatu tuto uon esse
arbitrabantur, de'scesserunt. Nau
reprehendo, nec quaero fuerime
aliquid pertimescendum ; pute suo
quemque arbitratu timere oportere,
de Domo, 8. The entire sentence
beginning with eo biduo, with
its rapid succession oi temporal
clauseS, the rapidity of whose
effect is heightened by the use oi
asyndeton, with its graphic de
scription oi the movements oi the
populace. is calculated to present
the urgency oi the popular de·
mand in a forcible manner. Cic-
ero seems to feel that his action
iu coming forward as ‘the cham·
pion oi a measure which would
give Pompey extraordinary power,
and thereby offend the Optimates,

may appear unwise, and therefore
calls ior justification. Its unwis·
dom would consist in its tendency
to estrange the Optimates at
the moment when Cicero needed
their help in getting indemnifica-
tion ior the loss of his house
on the Palatine. It would also
seem inconsistent with Cicero’s
political principles to advocate
increasing the power oi one of
the triumvirs. Cicero strives to
meet these two objections by pre·
senting the urgency oi the case
and the fact, if we may accept it
as a fact, that Pompey's appoint-
ment was lavored by the Beni
(verum etiam bonorum). Bo'ckel
acutely remarks that it may have
been the purpose oi Clodius to
force Cicero to propose the grant
of extraordinary powers, in order
to compromise him in the eyes of
the aristocracy and the penti ces.
He certainly succeeded in putting
him in a dilemma: to oppose the
bill would have been to brave the
wrath of the peopie and the en-
mity oi Pompey, who had labored
to secure his recall from exile3 to
favor the measure was to antago-
nize the aristocracy- quod ...

lerius Messalla Niger, consul in 61
uc. He is highly praised by Cic·
ero, in Art. 1. 14· 6, ior his integ·
rity. Messalla and Afranius were
supporters oi Pompey. On Aira-
