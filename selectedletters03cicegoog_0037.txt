m INTRODUCTION.

which Cassius won over the Parthians near Antioch averted
the threatened invasion ol Cilicia, and Cicero directed his
forces against the independent people near Mt. Amanus‚¹
where, after a complete victory, he had the satisfaction of
hearing himself saluted ‘imperator’ by his troops.⁹
25. Toward the end oi Dec, 51 ac, Cicero was in
Tarsus and sent thence official letters to the consuls
asking for a supplicatzb,⁸ accompanied by a letter ol similar
purport to Cato, the senatorial leader.4 The senate voted
the supplicatu? and, turning over his province to the
quaestor Caelius Caldus, on July 30, Cicero set out on his
homeward journey iu high hopes oi a triumph. There is no
more honorable period in Cicero's life than that ol his pro
' consulship in Cilicia ; and with the difficulties which he had
to iace, and the poor means at his disposal, his success as
an administrator was highly creditable. The lact that he
did' not reorganize his province on a permanent basis, as-
Caesar reorganized Gaul, is to be 'attributed to the shortness
ol his tenure ol office and the wretchedness oi the aristo·
cratic system ol government‚ and not to Cicero’s own
inability or unwillingness. Cicero traveled slowly horne-
ward by the way of Rhodes⁶ and Athens, accompanied by
his brother, his son, his nephew, and his freedman Tiro, who
was obliged t0 remain at Patrae on account oi illness.⁷ On
Nov. 24, 50 ac, he reached Brundisium, where he was met
by his wife Terentia.⁸ Alter a delay of several weeks at
his villas near Naples, Cicero at last reached Rome, Jan. 4,
49 a.c.,⁹ alter an absence from the city of a year and eight

months.
