a thread was wound about the middle ol it and sometimes
passed through the papyrus itsell, and aseal was attached

genuineness3 so, lor instance, upon one occasion, when
Cicero had opened some letters from Quintus to certain
friends, on the suspicion that they contained· slanderous
remarks about himself, he was not afraid ol the consequences,

good terms with her husband, had her husband's seal and
would not object to sealing the letters again.⁸ The seal
often had for its design the likeness of the owner⁴ or ol
one ol his ancestors.⁸ Wax was commonly used to receive
the impression, but sometimes Asiatic chalk.⁶ Upon the
outside of the roll the name ol the person addressed was
written in the dative, sometimes with ‚his title and the place
where he could be found, eg. M. Lucretio flamini Martis
decurioni Pompeiis!
