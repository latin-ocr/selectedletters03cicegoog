18 CICERO'S LETTERS.

[Ep. V.

clamoribus maximis, cum accusator tamquam censor
bonus homines nequissimos reiceret, reus tamquam
clemens lanista frugalissimum quemque secerneret, ut
primum iudices consederunt, valde diffidere boni coepe-
runt. 'Non enlm umquam turpior in ludo talario con-
sessus fuit: maculosi senatores, nudi· equiteS, tribuni
non tam aerarii quam, ut appellantur, aerati ; pauci
tamen boni inerant, quos reiectione fugare ille non

voluntate, Ep. 11.1 n. — accusa·
tor: L. Lentulus Crus. -lanista:
an owner apd trainer of bands ol
gladiators. As the kind-hearted
lanista avoids sending his best
gladiatore into encounters where
they will be sure to lose their
lives, so the defendant avoids
sending honest men into a jury-
box where they will lose their rep·
utation. For another explanation,
see Tyrrell. The correlation of ut
tacta est and ut primurn. ..
consederunt would not be found
in caretul prose- in ludo talario:
the vestis talaris reached to the
ankles, and was not worn by re
spectable people (cl. Gell. 6. [7]
12), and a ludus talarius was
probably an entertainment of a
low class where the performers
wore this garment; cl. Fronto,
Ep. p. 160 Naber laudo censoris
illud, qui ludos eblarios (effugeret),
quod semet ipsene diceret, cum ea
praeterisset, difficile degnitate' ser-
vire, quin ad nendum crotali aut
cymbali pedem poneret-macu-
losi: perhaps in its general sense,
perhaps with special reference to
men after whose names the censors
had placed a nora. — nudi, desti-
tute ,· cl. ineptiam, 2 n. -tribuni
. . . aerati: this is difficult to
understand. The common read·
ing is, non tam aerati . . . aera-
rii. The term aerarii was some-

times applied to citizens of the
lowest class, outside the limits of ,
the centuries of the Servian con·
stitution, the ‘riffraff ’ of the pop
ulation; and the phrase is under-
stood as meaning, ‘not so much
tribunes with money (aerati) as
tribunes without money or repu-
tation (aerarii).’ The objections
to this explanation are that the
point is obscure, and that in a list
oi the three classes ot people
composing the jury, where the
technical designatione have been
used in two instances, we expect
to find the third term used, and
used m the technical sense, ie we
expect senatores .eque'tes, trehuni
nontam aerarii. The transposi-
tion by a copyist of αενανὶι (or
aerari, as the MS. really reads)
and aerati would not be unnatural.
Il we may adopt the reading non
tarn aerarii . . . aerati, the expres·
sion would mean ‘not so much
tribunes who have money (for the
tribuni aerarii had money in
their charmes tribunes who are
to be ltrd f r money (aerati).'

This reading brings' into relies the
essentia] point, viz. the venality
of the judges. This conjecture
was first put forward by Muretus.
Cicero is quoting one ol those
witticisms current in Rome which
are so frequent in his letters; ‘not
so much tribuni aerarii as, to
