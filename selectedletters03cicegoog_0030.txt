15. Clodius skilfully prepared the way for an attack upon
Cicero by securing the passage of certain popular measures,
and, having gained the support of the consuls A. Gabinius
and L. Piso, between Mar. 20 and 25, 58 u.c.,¹ he secured the
adoption of a bill enacting: qui croam Romanum indemnatum
interemisset, ci aqua et igni interdiceretur.¹ The principle of
this bill was not new, and no one was mentioned in it by
name, but Cicero knew that it was directed against himself.
There can be little doubt that, in view of the Porcian and
Sempronian laws, the execution 'of Lentulus and his fellow·
conspirators, who were not allowed tomake an appeal to the
people, was unconstitutional. Cicero's plea, that the passage
of the senatus consultum⁴ultimum suspended this privilege,
and that Lentulus and the others, by ¹conspiring with the
Allobroges, had lost their right as citizens, is not a sufficient
ariswer. At all events, Cicero’s cause was a hopeless one.

The senators and knights were powerless, the consuls would ¹
give no help, and thetriumvirs were not loath to have Cicero
and Cato, who was at this time sent to Cyprus on a difficolt
mission, removed from the city before Caesar's departure.

16. This state of things had induced Cice'ro to withdraw
from the city before the law of Clodius was passed, and
soon after his departure the latter promulgated another
proposition in the following form : velitis iubentis utM. Tullio
aqua et igni interdictum sit.8 This bill, with the subsequent
modification that the interdiction should hold good within
a limit of 400 miles,⁴ was adopted about Apr. 200⁶ Cicero's
