Ι xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

46 nc.¹ Although he attended the meetings of the senate,
he took little active part in politics, save in working to secure ¹

the recall oi some Pompeians who were still in exile. At one
time Cicero hoped that Caesar would follow a conservative

course and would at least restore the senate to its old posi· ³

tion and influence, and it was with this hope in his mind

that he spoke so warmly oi him in his oration pro Marcello ‚· ζ

but he soon saw clearly that it was Caesar's purpose to ,

retain the supreme power in his own hands, especially when,
at the close oi the year 46, Caesar, on departing lor Spain,
leit the city in charge of eight praefecti, who were directly
responsible to his personal representatives‚ Cornelius Balbus
and C. Oppius.¹

35. Caesar defeated the last of the Pompeians, who had
rallied under the leadership oi Labienus and the two sons
of Pompey‚ at Munda,8 Mar. 17, 45 nc, and returned to
Rome in September to continue the reforms which he had
already begun, and to make preparations ior his great carn-

paign against the Parthians in the following year. In the χ

meantime a conspiracy was forming against him, led by a
lew disappointed officeseekers and fanatics, and iostered
by the traditional Roman prejudice against the title of rex
and the regal insignia. The indiscreet act oi Antony and
oi some other personal friend (or enemy l), in offering a
diadem to Caesar,⁴ and in crowning his statue with a laurel
wreath,⁶ strengthened the conspiracy, while Caesar’s own

course in openly assuming supreme power, a course iar 2

removed from the more diplomatic policy oi his successor
Augustus, must have offended the more conservative element.
The meeting oi the senate on Mar. 15, 44 rte„ iurnished a
suitable occasion, the presentation oi a petition by L. Tillius '
