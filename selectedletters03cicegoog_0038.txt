INTRODUCTlON.

Vl. CAESAR on Pourrav?1

(Aet. 58-59. rac. 49-48. Epist. XLll.-Llll.)

26. Cicero, upon his arrival, found political affairs ina
turmoil. The lex Vatinia of 59 uc. (i 13) had assigned Gallia
Cisalpina and Illyricum to Caesar for a periodos five years,
dating from Mar. r, 59 u.c.² By the lex Pompeia Licimh,
passed in '55 uu. (ξ 20), Caesar’s term of office was
entended lor aperiod of five years-probably, therefore,
to Mar. 1, 49 ne.⁸ Special legislation oi the year 52 uc. had
allowed Caesar to sue, in 49 uc, lor the consulship, without
personally attending the canvass (5 21). His successor
in the provinces would not naturally begin his term ol
ollice until Jan. 1, 48 uc, and in accordance with the
regular practice in such caseS, Caesar might count upon '
holding his provinces until that time, when he would pass
lrorn the provincial government to the consulship at Rome,
and thus avoid the snares which his enemies at Rome would
otherwise have set for him. But to frustrate this plan,
M. Marcellus, the consul, a bitter opponent ol Caesar, at·.
tempted, on Dec. 10, 50 uc. to induce the senate to pass
the senatusconsultum ultimum. Failing in this, he proceeded
to Naples, and on his own motion requested Pompey to
take charge ol the legions near Luceria⁴ and defend the
state. Pompey accepted the command ol the legions.

27. This o'vert act hastened the course ol events. On

Dec. 21 Curio, Caesar’s agent, leit Rome to go to Caesar‚⁶
and returned in time to present a formal ultimatum (cf.
