It grows in water two or three feet deep, and the plant

The stem of the plant was cut into thin strips, and these
strips were laid parallel to one another upon a smooth sur-

angles, and the two layers were glued together by the gum
which exuded irom the strips when they were moistened .
with water. The layers were then hammered together into
