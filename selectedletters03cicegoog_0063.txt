64. Letters were often written by secretarios lrorn dicta-
tion‚ but most oi Cicero’s letters to Atticus and Quintus
at least were written with his own hand3 for in 59 nc. he
writes to Atticus: numquam ante arbitror te epistulam meam
legisse, nisi mea manu smptam¹‚· and in 49 nc: lippitudinis
meae sigum tili sit librari manus²,· and in 54 ¹nc. to
Quintus: scribis enim te meas litteras superiores sategere
patuisse, in quo nihil earum, mi frater, fuit quae putas,· neque
emim occupatus eram neque perturbatus nec iratus alicui, sed
lrac sacia semper ut, quicunque calamus in mamus meas venerit,
eosic utar tamquam lano.³ During the latter part ol his
lile, however, especially during the years 44 and 43 nc,
even the letters to Atticus were written by a secretary.⁴
Cicero’s principal secretary was Tiro. Mention is also made
of another, Spintharus by namel

As there was no postal system at that time, letters had to
be sent by one's own messengers (tabellarii) or the messen-
gers oi one's friends. This made the composition of a letter
a more serious matter in Cicero’s day than it is in ours.
But his letters were not always studied productioris: some
ot them were written while he was traveling; others between
the courses at dinner⁸3 and he writes to Cassius⁷: praeposteras
habes tabellarias . . . cum a me discedunt, flagitant litteras . . .
atque idipsum facerent commodius, si milri aliquid spati ad ·
scribemdum darent, sed petasati ueniunt, comites ad partam
exspectare attunt.

Some idea ot the speed with which letters were carried
may be gathered from the following instances: letters arrived
at Rome {rom Brundisium on the sixth day, from Sicily on
