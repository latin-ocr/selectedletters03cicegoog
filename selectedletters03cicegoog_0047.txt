11 ι INTRODUCTION.

D. Brutus must make a determined stand in Gallia Cisalpina,
and that the govemors of the neighboring provinces must
be. induced to rally to' his support. He wrote therefore
urgent letters to D. Brutus, to Plancus in northern Gaul, to
Lepidus in southern Gaul, and to Pollio in Spain.¹ Brutus
and Cassius in the East were apprised of the course of events
in Italy,² and the senate'was urged to take bold action. -

42. His efforts were at the outset crowned with success,
for on Dec. 20, 44 B.C.,⁸ the senate repenled the law which
assigned Gallia Cisalpina and Transalpina to Antony,
lengthened the terms of office of D. Brutus and Plancus, and
directed the other provincial govemors to remain at their
posts until the senate should send out their successors.
Octavius and Hirtius, one of the consulS, left Rome in the
early part of 43 ue. to relieve D. Brutus,⁴ who was besieged
by Antony in Mutina, and Pansa, the other consul, followed
in March with four more legions of recruits.⁶¹ Alter some
preliminary skirmishing in which Antony gained the advan-

· tage,⁶ a decisive battle was fought near Mutina, Apr. 21,' in

which his army was completely defeated. But the victory
· was dearly bought. Hirtius fell upon the field of battle,
and Pansa was mortally wounded⁸ and died two days later.
The command of the forces acting against Antony was
assigned to D. Brutus. OctaviuS, who had good reason
to feel aggrieved at this slight‚⁹ withdrew from further
participation in the struggle, and marched to Rome at the
head of eight legions, demanding the consulship.⁹ There
was no means at hand to withstand him, and Aug. 19 he
was elected consul, although but nineteen years of age.⁹
