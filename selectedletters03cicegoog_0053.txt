· xlvi · INTRODUCTION.

No one could have been more unlike Cicero than his
only son Marcus, and it would be humorous, if it were not
pathetic, to see the orator hopefully instructing the would-be
soldier in the mysteries of philosophy and law. But when
the boy had taken up the profession of arms under Brutus,
and thus brought to naught the father's hope that his son
would succeed him at the bar and in the senate, Cicero
gracefully accepted the inevitable. He followed his son’s
movements with the liveliest interest, and heard with pater-
nal pride the reports of his prowess

To his brother Quintus, Cicero was always loyal and
devoted. Their friendly relations were broken but once‚¹
and then only for a brief period. They were men of very
different temperaments. Marcus acted in general with
deliberation; sometimes, in fact, he hesitated too long.
Quintus was nervous and impulsive.

One dwells‚ however, with most pleasure upon Cicero’s
treatment of his personal dependents. Not only his favorite
freedman Tiro, but the very slaves of his household enjoyed
his kindness and generosity.

5ο. This sympathetic sensitiveness in Cicero’s nature
gives to his character its special charm, and constitutos at
the same time its principal weakness. ,Those moments of

exaltation and of depression, those periods when he help· Ι ¹
lessly fluctuates between different courses of action,¹ lind
their explanation in this quality. His humor is determined
by the circumstances of the moment. He lacks, therefore,
the calm poise of the less impressionable nature. He fails
to give things their proper pro-portiom, and consequently
his forecasts of the future are generally either too sanguine

or too gloomy. lt was this quality, of course, which made
him an opportunist in politics.
