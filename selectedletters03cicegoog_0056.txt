53. Tullia, Cicero's only daughter, was probably born in
79 or 78 nc. In 66 nc. she was betrothed to C. Calpurnius
Piso Frugi,¹ and married him sometime within the next
three years. He died during the year 66 Cicero’s exile.l

In 56 nc. Tullia married Furius Crassipes.⁸ The match '

was regarded as a good one, but for reasons unknown to
us Crassipes and Tullia were soon divorced. Her next
matrimonial venture was with P. Cornelius Dolabella,⁴ the
Caesarian politician. Their married life proved to bea
most unhappy one, and they were probably divorced towards
the close 66 the year 46 rae.⁵ Tullia herself died in Feb,
45 s.e.,⁶ and her father was plunged in the deepest grief, in
which his friends Caesar, Lucceius, Sulpicius, and others
sought to comfort him by letters 66 6666616666]

Marcus Turnus C1cnn0 marus.

54. Cicero's only son Marcus was born in 65 uc. The
father gave his personal attention ior some time to the
young man's education‚ and sent him later to Athens to
pursue his studies, in the hope that he would take up
the legal profession; but the young man’s tastes were
averse to study, and the appearance 66 Brutus at Athens,
in 44 nc, was enough to cause his enlistment in the
army 66 the liberatores, in which he served with distinction.⁸
He espoused the cause 66 Octavius against Antony, was
made consul by the former in 30 13.c.,⁹ and is last heard 66
as proconsul 66 Asia.
