the familiar intercourse oi everyday life, as opposed to
the more formal diction adopted in literary compositions
intended for a more general audience or body oi readers.

70. F ormal and informal Latin, ii they may be so desig·
nated, are in their origin independent oi one another. At
the moment when Latin literature began, inasmuch as differ· η
ences in culture did not exist, there was but one Latin
spoken by patrician and plebeian alike. With the appear-
ance of literature, Latin developed along two different lines.
The poetS, especially Ennius, in adapting Latin to literary
purposes‚ adopted certain words and forms of expression
and rejected others, On the other hand, the people, in their
. daily lite, were more conservative, retaining much oi that
, which literature rejected,¹ while at the same time they
adopted many n'ew forms of expression which formal litera·
ture either did not employ at all or accepted at a later date.
In particular these literary pioneers, being steeped in Greek
literature, unconsciously sought to develop literary Latin
in accordance with the genius oi the Greek language. This ·
latter influence acted only indirectly upon colloquial speech.

71. The cleit thus resulting continued to widen, until, in
course of time, certain distinct and interesting differences
are noticeable between formal and informal Latin. ot
course important differences are found only between, the
extremes oi these two forms of speech. Cicero himself inti-
mates that we may expect to find in his letters evidences of
colloquialism, {or he writes to his iriend'Paetus (Fam. 9. 21.
