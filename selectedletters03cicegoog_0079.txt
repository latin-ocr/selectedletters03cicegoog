⁹³· Alliteratioa- While alliteration is found in the prose
and poetry οἱ all periods, it is especially common in ancient
legal and religious formulae and in popular sayings. As

’ the latter appear in large numbers in the more familiar
letters, alliteration becomes one o( the stylistic character-
istics of Cicero's correspondente. Cf. cura, cogitatio, . .
maculatio causarum (Fam. 9. ao, r) ; opera cl alcum (Art.
2⁴ ¹7- ι).

94. Asyndetan. In addition to asyndeton for emphasis
and between clauses in lively narration, which is found
in contemporaneons formal literature, Biickel ¹ calls attention
to two classes o( cases in which asyndeton occurs in the
Letters, as it does in other colloquial literature, with great
frequeney: (r) between two expressions of opposite mean—
ing, eg. palam secreto (Cael., Fam. Β. r. 4)Υ velit nolit (Q.
sr. 3. 8. 4) ; (2) between two expressions o( similar meaning,
eg. intercedens impediendi (Fam. 8. 8. 6), certa clara (Ate. 16.
¹³⁰⁴ π). Many ot these expressions, like those dismissed
under Alliteraeian, are stereotyped popular phrases.

95. Brevity. Brevity is secured in many cases by the use
of pregnant expressions, and by the omission of words and
phrases ιιωι :ilmnlmely necessary to the sense. The words
most commonly omitted axe exse, dicere (many ior-ms asboth
words :ire (nummi), fieri, aedes, and the pronoun as an
object or as the subject os an infinitive.

In sun-ic inmunes more uncommon ellipses occur, eg.
ex Gallia [profunda] Lepidi (Pollio, Fam. ιο. ³³- 4); hoc
»rufis anim rrrsmn est, quod intacms ab sibilo pervenerat
mumius adsenesmtm; sed tum tam bene (sibilans est) ue
in mrum vllam quomis satis esst! (Cael., Fam. 8. 2. ι). Οἱ.
