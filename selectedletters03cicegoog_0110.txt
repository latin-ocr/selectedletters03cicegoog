Art. 1. 16.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 2⁷

et iucunda consuetudine coniuncti inter nos sumus,
usque eo, ut nostri isti comissatores coniurationis,
barbatuli iuvenes, illum in sermonibus Cn. Ciceronem
appellent. Itaque et ludis et gladiatoribus mirandas
ἐπισημασίας sine ulla pastoricia fistula auferebamus.
Nunc est exspectatio comitiorum, in quae omnibus invi- 12
tis trudit noster Magnus Auli filium, atque in eo neque
auctoritate neque gratia pugnat, sed quibus Philippus
omnia castella expugnari posse dicebat in quae modo
asellus onustus auro posset ascendere; consul autem
ille deterioris histrionis similis suscepisse negotium
dicitur et domi divisores habere, quod ego non cred0.

had indulged in this caustic ar·
raignment ol Pompey: nillil come,
nillil simplex, nihil ἐν τοῖς πολιτι-
κοῖς illustre, nihil honestum, nillil
sorte, m'lzil liberum (An. 1. 13. 4).
-isti comissatores coniuratio-
¹nis, tlzose who conspired only over
tlreir witteeups (Tyrrell).—bar-
batuli: Caelius, Dolabella, Curio
filius, Clodius, etc. Cf. note to
pulchellus, 1o.— Cn. Ciceronem:
the nickname given to Pompey
may suggest that he was as vacil-
lating as Cicero in his actions, as
Mommsen explains it, or that the
friendship between Cicero and
Pompey was so close as to make
thern one. -ludis et gladiatori-
bus: colloquial ablatives of time.
Cf. lntr. 83 d. Such colloquial
ablatives Cicero has with one ex·
ception (Philipp. 9. 16) avoided
outside the letters. The ludi re·
ferred to were probably the ludi
Megalenses in April. — ἐπισημα-
σίαις these indications of popu-
larity were probably given when
Cicero and Pompey entered while
the games were being held. For a

also common (Ep. V11j2).

12. comitiorum: the consular
election-Auli lilium: ie. L.
Afranius. By designating him as
Auli lilium Cicero means perhaps
that Afranius was himself arnan oi
no worth. He was consul in 60
u.c., proconsul ol Gallia Cisal·
pina in 59 ue, was pardoned by
Caesar lor espousing the cause of
Pompey in the Civil War, joined
the Pompeian forces again, and was
captured and put to death alter the
battle of Thapsus— Philippus:
the methods of Philip of Macedon
had become proverbial. Cf. Hor.
