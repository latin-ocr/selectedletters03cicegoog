[Ep. XXV.

cautior quam in advocationibus, qui neque in Oceano
natare volueris, studiosissimus homo natandi, neque
spectare essedarios, quern antea ne andabata quidem
defraudare poteramus. Sed iam satis iocati sumus.

Romans. See Intr.99.-cautior,
mare discrcct. Cavcrc as a legal
term means, ‘to provide for a per-
son,’ as his connsel. Cicero sug·
gests that Trebatius showed more
discretiori as a soldier, in keeping
out of range, than he did as a law·
yer. The same pun occurs in an-
other letter to Trebatius(Fam.7. 6.
2) tu, qui ceteris cavere didicisti, in
Britannia ne ab essedariis decipia-
ris caveto. One of the main sources
of humor in Cicero's letters to
Trebatius lies in the double mean·

were especially dreaded by the
Roman soldiers.—defraudare: a
colloquial word, which, though
common enough in Plautus and
Terence, Cicero uses elsewhere
perhaps only in a proverbial ex-
pression, Or. 221. .

3. mercule: this oath is found
in Cicero’s correspondence in the
forms, hercules, mehercules (or
nrcrcules), and mehercule (or mer·
cale). Cicero himself writes (Or.
157) mehercule lr'bcntius dixerim
quam mehercules, and the more
polished letter-writers of this pe-
riod seem to have agreed with
