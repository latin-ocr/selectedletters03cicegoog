statement that Cicero edited the
poem de Rerum Natura has given
rise to a deal of discussion. lt is
certainly true that Cicero and Lu-
cretius exerted an influence upon
each other. Lucretius borrowed
freely from Cicero's Aratea, while
several passages in the philosoph-
ical writings of Cicero closely
resemble verses of Lucretius (cf.
Martha, Le Polou de Lucr2cc, 3 51,
Munro on Lucr. 5619 and Merrill
in Closs. Rev. for 1896, 19).-

Trebatius Testa, the date of whose
birth is uncertain, came as a boy
to Rome to study law. He be·
came attached to Cicero, and
pleased the latter by both his wit
and good-fellowship, and also as·
sisted him by his knowledge of
jurisprudence. Being anxiouS,
however, to see something of the
world, to win his spurs, and to
make a fortune, perhaps, in the
provinces, Trebatius set out for
the Roman camp in Gaul, carrying
with him this letter of recommen-
dation. Cicero's relations with
Trebatius were of a most intimate
nature, as his seventeen letters to
him (Fam. 7. 6-22) prove. Like
most of the young men who served
illicitititillat?
and followed his fortunes in the
Civil War. He was one of the few
members of' that coterie of young
men about Caesar who survived

“ the Civil War and lived to see

Rome at peace under Augus
