CICERO'S LETTERS. 137

Art. 6. 1.]

fui. Habes ad omnia, non, ut postulasti, χρύσεα
χαλκείων, sed paria paribus respondimus. Ecce autem ²3
alia pusilla epistula, quam non relinquam ὰναντιφώνητον.
Bene mehercule proposuit Lucceius Tusculanum, nisi
forte dolet ei quod suo tibicine egebit. Velim scire ’
qui sit status eius Lentulum quidem nostrum omnia
praeter Tusculanum proscripsisse audio, Cupio hos
expeditos videre, cupio etiam Sestium, adde sis Cae-
lium, in quibus omnibus est

Αἴδεσθεν μὲν ἀνήνασθαι, δεῖσαν δ’ ὑποδέχθαι.

For a similar comparison of his used to indicate a transition where

peaceiul achievements with the
military successes of Pompey and
others, cf. Ep. ΙΙΙ. 3; in Cat. 4.
21 f. -χρύσεα χαλκείων and paria
paribus (respondere) areproverbial
expressions; ci. eg. Il. 6. 2363
Plato, Symp. 219A3 Ter. Phorm.
212. For the alliteration, cf. Intr.
,93. The Latin expression occurs
in a fuller torm in Plaut. Pers. 22 3
par pari respondes dieto. This
substantival use ot a neuter adj.
in the dat. is very unusual in Latin.
The nearest parallel in Cicero is
parvo magnis conferuntur, Orat.
{atttriti §.mittitete

no surprise is expressed‚ cf. Intr.
91. — ἀναντιῲὥνητον, without an
antwer. There are more than 70
Greek words in the Letters con-
taining α privative. Their fre·
quency in colloquial language is

dne to the iact that they enabled ·

a writer to avoid a long Latin ex·
pression; ct. Intr. 9 5.- proposuit,
bas suffered sor sale. - Lucceius:
not the historian. This Lucceius
was so heavily in debt (Ait. 5. 21.
13) that he proposed to sell his

and ostentimes one which causes ue, accompanied Pompey to

cal dative, cf. Intr. 83 c. This ior si νῖν, as frequently in Latin
use oi ecceis in harmony with its comedy and satire. Cf. sultis for
