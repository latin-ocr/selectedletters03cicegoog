Epist. XLll., intr.) to the senate Jan. 1, 49 ue, when the con-

suls L. Lentulus Crus and C. Claudius Marcellus assumed y

office. Caesar's proposals were not accepted, and a resolu-
tion was passed declaring that he would bc acting adversus
rempublicam iihe did not give up his army by July 1,49 u.0.¹;
and on Jany the senatus consultum ultimum 'was passed, upon

which the tribunes Antonius and Cassius,⁸ as well as Curio χ

and Caelius, set‘out ior Caesar’s camp.

28. Cicero’s position made him an eminently fit person
to effect a compromise.4 He proposed that Pompey should
go to Spain, and that Caesar should not be compelled to
attend his canvass in person ⁵3 but his efforts were fruitless.

On Jan. ιο Caesar crossed the Rubicon⁶ with five cohorts ,

and marched toward Rome, taking Pisaurum, Fanum, and
Ancona on his way. On Jan. 14 the senate passed the
decretum tumultus,⁷ bui the news oi Caesar’s rapid advance
forced Pompey, the consuls, and senators to leave Rome,⁸
Jan. 17, and hurry southward.

29. Cicero leit the city the same day. The senate had Ἴ

assigned the Campanian district to him, but he saw that
little could be done,⁹ because the inhabitants oi Campania
had many oi them received their lands through Caesar's
law (i 13). Furthermore he hoped ior peace, and thought
that¹ neutrality on his part would best fit him to act as
mediator between the opposing forces3 and to maintain his
neutral position, he gave up his appointment in Campania
just beiore leaving the city, and took charge, in a civil capa-
city, oi the Roman Campagna and the coast oi Latium.¹⁰
