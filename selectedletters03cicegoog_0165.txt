Ν. H. 36.115),was the first per-
manent theatre constructed in
Rome, and its opening was cele·
brated by gorgeous pageants and
by combats between men and wild
beasts, in which, according to
Pliny, 20 elephante and 500 lions
were killed. The distaste which
Cicero shows ior the vulgar dis-
play, and the pity which the slaugh-
ter of the unfortunate beasts ex-
cited in him, honorablydistinguish
him from his contemporaries.
These particular venationes were so
bloodthirsty that even the Roman
populace was moved to pity when
the elephante, seeing their escape

cut off, seerned to beg for mercyz,

ltalians of the present day who
have villas on the lakes or sea-
shore, often cut down the trees

intrant oi their houses, that they
may 'obtain an unobstructed view
across the water; so Marius would

in a line through his Stabian e:-
tate (lit. ‘he bored through ') to
the shore, and thus brought the
bay into view-lectiunculis, by
reading a bit here ond a bit there.
mimos: the mimus, which was
introduced into Rome from Taren-
tum in the third century 1³.c., was
at the outset a character presenta-
tion by dancers, but, in the sec-
ond century probably, dialogue
andsongs were introduced. Facial
expression always played an im-
portant part in it, so that the per·
formers did not wear masks. In
Cicero’s time misni were put on
the stage only as aiterpieces (cf.
Ep. LXI. 7). The degraded taste
of imperial times, however, pre·
ferred them to the drama proper,
so that they practically drove the
latter from the stage. Cf. also

period dramatic performances be-

for whom seats were not reserved
