xx INTRODUCTION.

10. ln December of this year, while Caesar was absent
in Spain, a festival was held at his house in honor of the
goddess -Bona Dea, which it was unlawtul tormen to attend 3
but during the meeting, P. Clodius, a patrician, was found

to be present in disguise (cf. Epist. V.). A ¹y'udicial ³

investigation of the matter was made, but Clodius secured

an acquittal through the kind offices ot Crassus, who 1

three hours of the time* he claimed¹ to have been at Inter· Ἴ

that the affair, which at 'the outset was a purely personal
one, developed into a political antagonism.⁴

11. In Jan, 61 rac, before the trial of Clodius took place,
Pompey returned from the East. Both the senatorial party
and the democratic party were anxious to secure his support ;
but, with that tatuity which characterized his conduct so
often, he satisfied neither taction. The senate, however,
found an opportunity to punish him for his coldness toward
them by declining either to ratify his arrangements in the
