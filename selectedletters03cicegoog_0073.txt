The Substantive.

83. (a) The accusative is used a little more freely in
the Letters than in formal literature. It occurs after
verbs of thought and the expression oi thought, and
alter verbs signiiying to striae, to langii, to lropn, etc.;
eg. icoc a te praesens contendissem (Caei, Fam. 8. ⁴16. 4);
Catnlnm milti narras (Fam. 9. 15. 3); iurare Iovem Lapidem
(Fam 7. 12. 2); qnam pn'mnm naec risnm veni (Cael, Fam.
8. 14. 4). Two accusatives occur in a {ew instances aiter
verbs signiiying to seek, ta wara, etc.; eg. illncl antem te
peto (Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2); qnod et respublica me et nostra
amicitia hortatur (Catu, Fam. 15. 5. 1); andan adverbial
accusative made up oi partem and the adjective magnam or
maiorem or minimam is found several times; eg. curare
soles libenter, nt ego maiorem partem niirr'l curare (Cael, Fam.

8. 9. 3). Cf. note to qnod me hortatur, Epist. XXXVII. 1.
’ (d) With the exception oi a few Grecisms, eg. cogitatio
dignissima tnaenirtntis (Balbus, Att. 8. 15a. 1)‚'the only
thing noteworthy with respect to the genitive consists iu the
rather free use oi the genitive of quality and the partitive
genitive. Cf. aliquo terrarum, Epist. LXXXVI. 3 n.

(c) The elatine eff reference and the etlrical datrae are
great lavorites in the LetterS, the latter especially with at,
ecce, and nic. Perhaps in their use oi the ethical dative
Cicero and his correspondents have been surpassed only by
the writers oi comedy. Cf. ecce tibi et Bruti et tnae litterae
(Att. 14. 19. 1); atille tibi . . . pergit Brundisium (Act. 8.
8. 2). Cf. also notes to minori curae, Epist. XXV. 2, and to
ecce, Epist. XXXV. 23.

·(d) Certain public events, recurring at regular or irreg-
ular intervals‚ were ol such importance in the eyes ol the
people that they were used in marking the date oi an event.
