especially those to Atticus, offer constant illustration. ’ He
prided himself upon the fluency with which he could use
Greek in speaking and writing. He was an insatiable book-
buyer and a connoisseur in art (ξ 45 n. 3). The circle of
his friends included every one worth knowing at Rome,-
politi'cians, whether of the aristocratic or democratic factions,
literary men, business men, and men of leisure.

No better proof could be desired of Cicero’s sympathetic '
nature and manysidedness than the fact that he drew to
himself persons of all tastes, beliefs, and ages. He wasa
friend not only of the eminent jurist Servius Sulpicius
Rufus, and the learned antiquary Varr0, but also of
Caesar’s witty aide-doram Trebatius, oi the elever young
politician Caelius, and the accomplished Caerellia.

49. In his family relations Cicero was a true and court-
'eous husband, a father indulgent to his children, but wisely
thoughtful for their interests ln his relations with his wife
Terentia he stands in honorable contrast to many prominent
men of his time, and his divorcc from her, which took place
after a married life of thirty years, was the almost inevitable
result of the lack of sympathy existing between two such-
opposite natures; and aknowledge of the great frequency
of divorce in his day may properly modify the severity of
our judgment upon himin this matter. ’

His second wife Publilia, who was much younger than
himself, he probably married for her money,¹ and the union
proved utterly disagreeable to him. All the wealth of his
affection was bestowed upon his daughter Tullia. Her
nature was impressionable like his own, so that she under·
stood her father and sympathized with him in his periods
of exaltation and depressi0n‚ while the unhappiness which
followed her through life only served to bring out her
father’s tenderness.
