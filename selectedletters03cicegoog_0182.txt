CICERO’S LETTERS. 99 Ι

rabiosulas sat fatuas dedisti; deinde quod τῶν Βρεττα-
νῶν minus φιλοθέωρον te praebuisti, plane non repre-
hendo Nunc veroin hibernis iniectus mihi videris,
itaque te commovere non curas.

Vsquequaque sapere oportet3 id erit telum acerrimum.

Ego si foris cenitarem, Cn. Octavio familiari tuo non 2

1. Equo Troiano: cf. Ep. XIX. a tridecrazy. Cf. pulchellus, Ep.
2 n. — sero sapiunt: Cicero V. 10 n. The phrase, rabiosulas

quotes here, as he did in Ep. XIX.
2 (si sciens salla), the first words
of a familiar passage, which had
passed into a proverb. The ex-
pression is thus explained by Fes-
tus, Ι. 510, de Pon. ε ‘sero sapiunt
Phryges’ proverbium est natum a
Troianis qui decima denique anna
velle caeperunt Helenam quaeque
cum ea erant rapta reddere. Cf. also
Ribbeck,le Trag 49 non se

ro: Trebatius had gone to Caesar
with such rose· colored ideas of a
soldier’s life and of the immediate
wealth and distinction to be won
in it, that the inevitable hardships
and monotony made him discon-
tented and hosnesick, so that Cic-
ero had written him reprovingly:
primarum mensum litteris tuis ae-
lsementer commovebar, quad milei
interdum- pace tica dixerim-
leuis in urbis urbanitatisque desi·
deria, interdum piger, interdurn
timidus in labare militari, saepe
autem etiam, quod a te alienissi-
mum est, subimpudens videbare;
tamquam enim syngrapham ad
imperatorem, nan epistulam attu-
lisses, etc.‚ Fam. 7. 17. 1. This
letter evidently had the effect in·
tended, for Cicero’s words, non
sero, as well as mi vetule, indi-
cate that Trebatius had repented

sat fatuas, is probably quoted
from some comic poet Cf, how-
ever, Ribbeck, Cam. Ram. Frag

p.xliv.- τῶν Βρεττανῶν minus
φιλοθέωρον, nat very fond ef see-
ing tlte sights in Britain. ln the
summer of 55 nc. Caesar made
his first expedition to Britain, in
which Trebatius did not care to
join. —fn hibernis iniectus: Cic·
ero is writing toward the end 0'f
November.— te commovere, to
sti,·r as of one crawling out from
under a blanket' rn cold weather -
usquequaque, ete: probably the
words of Ulysses rn the same play
from which the quotation sero
sapiunt was taken. Cf. Ribbeck,
le. T rag. p. 49, and T rag. Rom.
Frag. p. rao-sapere: perhaps
with a double meaning, ta be wisc
and ta be learned in tlte law. Cf.
Ep. XXV. 1 n.—id erit telum
acerrimum: Mezger quotes Fal-
staff’s words, ‘Discretion is the
better part of valor)

2. cenitarem: this frequentative
is not found in Cicero outside of
the Letters.— Cn. Octavio: evi·
dently a pushing fellow‚ who
wanted the distinction of enter-
taining Cicero. Cf. Fam. 7. 9. 3
Cn. Octauius est an Cn. Cornelius
quidam, tuus familiaris, summo

of hisdiscontent.-primas illas: genere natus, terrae filius. Is me,

sc. tuas epistulas. - rabiosulas,

quia scit tuum familiarem esse,
