52. A fair knowledge of the relations existing between⁸ i

Cicero and his wife Terentia may be gained from the letters
of Bk. 14, ad Fam„ all of which are addressed 'to her. Iri
the early 'letters of this correspondence written in 58 Bc,
after twenty years of married life, Cicero expresses himself
in most affectionate terms. 'After this date, with the excep· Ι
tion of one letter in 50 13.c., which is mainly upon business
matters, there are n‘o letters to Terentia up to 49 ac„
although this interval includes the period of his procon-
sulship‚ when he wrote so many letters to his personal and
political friends. Even the letters of the year 49, when
Cicero was iu so much anxiety, are very infrequent. The
rest of the letters of Bk. 14, belonging to the next two
yearS, are brief and formal. It appears that an estrange·
ment gradually grew up between them which·culminated
in their divorce in the early part of 46 uc. ln December
of the same year he married his rich ward Publilia¹; but
Publilia could not conceal her chagrin at finding herself
second to Tullia in his affection, and when she evinced
joy a few months later at Tullia's death, Cicero sent her to
her mother and could not be induced to receive her back

into his favor.²
