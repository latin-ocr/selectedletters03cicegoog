of these are the character of the person addressed and his
relations to the writer, the subject or subjects discussed‚

w'itn local differences in familiar speech and with those
which time effects, the student who confines hisflattention
to Cicero’s correspondence is not concerned, as the letters

by men who spoke Latin as it was spoken in the city oi
Rome. The other lactors are of interest. One cannot fail
to notice the freedom and informality with which Cicero
