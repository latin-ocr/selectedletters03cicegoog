96. Extratragance inExprcssion. Formal literary compo ·
sitions which are intended for publication, and which must
therefore submit to the criticism ot the general public, are
more reserved in their expression than is the familiar inter-
course between friends, whether carried on by conversation or
correspondence. Abundant illustration of this fact is offered

in the letters which passed between Cicero and his intimate ·

friends, both in the use of single words and complete state
ments, eg. immortalri=magnas (Plancus, Fam. ιο. 11. r):
immortalis ago tibi gratias ,· infinitis=multrs (Pollio, Fam.
10. 3²· 4): infinitis pollicitationibus. Ci. also nam, cum maxi·
mam cepissem laetitiam ex humanissimi et carissimi patris
epistula, tum vero iucundissimae tuae litterae cumulum milri
gaudii attulerunt (Cicero filius, Fam. 16. 21. 1). Cf. note
to demiror, Epist. XXVI. 4.

97. Greek Words and phrases. As Tyrrell remarks,¹

· Greek words aud phrases generally appear in the Corre-

spondence as technical terms in philosophy, rhetoric, politics,
medicine, and as slang phrases. Doubtless‚ also, as Cicero

himself intimates, Greek was occasionally used as apossible Ι

protection if a lelter should tall into the hands of an enemy.
The Greek technical terms played the same part with ref·
erenceto Latin that many ol the corresponding technical
terms borrowed from Latin play in modern composition,
while the Greek popular expressions in the Letters may be
compared with current French phrases. cf. also note to
παρρησίαν, Epist. V. 8.

98. Exclamatery Questions. These questions belong to
the language of'everyday life, and almost every one of the
familiar letters offers illustrations of the use of such exclam-
atory phrases as quid iamt cur hoel etc. cf. also ξ 92
and note to quid quaeres, Epist. V. 4.
