57. Tiro, the slave and freedmau, deserves a place
among the members ot Cicero’s family because ot the
intimate terms upon which he lived with all the members
of it. He was his master's secretary and accompanied him
wherever he went. Cicero’s affection ior him is evident
irom the ¹letters oi Bk. 16, ad Fam„ most of which are
letters written to Tiro by Cicero. He was a man of
cultivation, and his criticism was oi great service to Cicero,
who writes to him: tu, qui κανὼν esse meorum scriptorum
soles.1 He did some independent literary work in writing a
life of his patron‚² in making a collection ot his witticisms,³

and in editing a collection of stenographical abbreviations.
He apparently wrote some tragedies also*
