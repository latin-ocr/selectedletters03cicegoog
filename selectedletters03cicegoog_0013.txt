the Epthtulae ad Atticum is that of Ο. Ε. Schmidt. For further
particulars the reader m'ay consult the Introduction and the
statement in the Critical Appendix.

The orthography has been, in general, conformed to the
¹standards established by Brambach and by Georges in his
chikon der lateinischen Wortsormen.

In the Introduction and the Commentary attention has been
directed in particular to the characteristics of epistolary and
colloquial Latin. A full discussion ol these peculiarities would
have far transcended the limits of this book. The editor has
therefore contented himself with a statement in the Introduc·
tion of the most important divergencies which the Letters show
in lexicography, syntax, and style from the standard ·in those
matters in formal Latin, and has supplemented this general

statement by more detailed notes at the proper points in the

' Commentary,.

The works which the editor has found of most service in the
preparation of the Introduction and Commentary are men-
tioned in the list given on a subsequent page, and although his
indebtedness is usually noted specifically in the Commentary,

he feels under special obligation to the editions of Tyrrell, .

Watson‚ stpflesstcku, and Hofmann-hndresen, and to the
writings of Ο. Ε. Schmidt and Landgraf.

But, above all, the editor would gratefully acknowledge the
deep obligation which he is under to Professors C. L. Smith
and Tracy Peclc the editors-inchief oi this Series, for the care
ful criticism which they have given to this work while it has
been passing through the press. F· F· A·
