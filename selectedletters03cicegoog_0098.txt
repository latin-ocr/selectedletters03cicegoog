was entrusted to the praetor, his
consilium, and the iudices. The
praetor passed upon questions of
law, in the decision of which he
was assisted by the consilium, a
body of jurists called in to give
legal advice, while questions of
fact were relegated to the iudices.
A list of several hundred iudices,
chosen under the lex Aurelia of
70 uc. from the ranks of the sen·
ators, knights, and tribuni aerarii
(fiscal officials oi the tribes; cf.
Momm. St. R. ΙΙΙ. 189-196), was
published at the beginning of

iudices for a particular trial were
selected by lot. A verdict ren·
dered by a majority of thern was
valid.

to the movements of the Catili-
