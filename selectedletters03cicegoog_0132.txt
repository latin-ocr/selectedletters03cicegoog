Aet. 3. 4.] CICERO'S LETTERS. ’ 49

discessimus; adlata est enim nobis rogatio de pernicie
mea, in qua quod correctum esse audieramus erat eius-
modi, ut mihi ultra quadringenta milia liceret esse, illo
pervenire non liceret. Statim iter Brundisium versus
contuli ante diem rogationis, ne et Sica, apud quern
eram, periret et quod Melitae esse non licebat. Nunc
tu propera ut nos consequare, si modo recipiemur.
Adhuc invitamur benigne, sed quod superest timemus.

placed side by side that the reader
can discover the true key to his
character, which is to be found in
the fact that he was peculiarly sen-
sitive to his surroundings, and was
exalted or depressed by circum-
stances which would have had no
abiding influence upon a more
phlegmatic nature (cf. Intr. 50).

Without waiting to see what ac-
tion would be taken upon the bill
of Clodius, which did not mention
him by name (qui cibem Romanum
indemnatum interemisset, ei aqua
et igni interdiceretur, Vell. Patere.
a. 45), Cicero left Rome about
March 20, 58 nc, and went to his
friend Sica, near Vibo. Here news
reached him of the amended bill
directed against him personally.
He therefore hastily left Vibo for
Tarentum and Brundisium. See
lntr.15f.

The rogatio in this case read as
follows: velitis iubeatis ut M.
Ilellio aqua et igni interdictum sit;
cf. CiedeDomo, 47.— correctum:
the amended bill forbade Cicero
to remain at any point within 400
miles of Italy. After a bill had
been brought forward an interval
of 17 days, a trinundinum (ef.

vote was taken upon it, during
which time it could be modified.

carelessly used for et ne, as the
force of ne does not extend to
the second of the two correlative
clauses- ne . . . periret: those
who should harbor an exile within
the prescribed limits made them—
selves liable to a severe penalty.
- Melitae: Malta was within the
⁴eoo-mile limit.—mi Pomponi:
Cicero rarely addresses his corre-
spondent by name ina letter. In
the 397 letters to Atticus, Atticus
is addressed by name only 28
times: mi Attice nineteen times,
mi Tite once, and mi T. Pom·
poni once, otherwise as in this
letter. The omission of the prae-
