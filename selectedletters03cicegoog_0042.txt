with hostile soldiers. At the same time Caesar's critical
position in Egypt¹ made it quite possible that the Pompeian
cause might succeed after all, in which case Cicero’s standing
would be still more precarious. His family affairs ‘were

Ι equally distressing: Tullia, his daughter, was most unhappy
with her husband Dolabella; Terentia's management of his ι
property¹ during his absence had caused him a deal of ‚

vexation; an unfortunate misunderstanding had sprung up
with his brother Quintus.³ .

somewhat relieved in Sept, 47 uc, by the arrival of Caesar,
who generously gave him permission to remain in Italy.⁴
He went almost directly to Rome, and his letters in the
main, up to the close of 46 ne, were written either in that

’ city or at his villas at Tusculum and Cumae. The battle

supremacy in Africa was established, but the tidings

that Cato had taken his own life at Utica,⁷ feeling that the
cause oi the Republic was beyond hope. The little memoir

called forth opposition pamphlets from the Caesarians,
Hirtius⁹and Brutus,¹⁰ and even Caesar found time on the
eve oi the battle of Munda to write an ‘Anticum’ ¹¹

period. The Orator was written and the Brutus finished in
