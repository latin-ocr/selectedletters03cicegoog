itum ut nihil possit fieri ornatius; sed incidi in ipsam
flammam civilis discordiae vel potius belli, cui cum
cuperem mederi et, ut arbitror, possem, cupiditates
certorum hominum (narn ex utraque parte sunt qui
pugnare cupiant) impedimento mihi fuerunt. Omnino

tics, and his friendly relations with
both Caesar and Pompey, seemed
to make him the natural mediator
between the opposing factiuns.
That he hoped to effect a com-
promise is clear from many re
marks in the Letters (ci, eg, Ep.
LXV. 5). What many condemn
as cowardice in his course during
the Civil War finds at least partial
justification in his desire to keep
a neutral attitude, which would
enable him to negotiare a peace.

others Cicero is thinking oi the
Pompeians Scipio and lentulus
and the Caesarians Antony and
Cassius; cf. Caes. B. C. r. 1-4, and
