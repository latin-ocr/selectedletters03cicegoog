is but a single example of nc with the indefinite second
person present subjunctive in a prohibition’¹; and that,
furthermore, prohibitions expressed by nc with the present
or the perfect subjunctive, laclr the dignity of the noli-con-
struction, and are consequently confined to informal Latin.2
, Quite naturally, therefore, many oi these prohibitions
expressed by nc with the present subjunctive, and the
majority of those expressed by nc with the perfect subjunc-
tive, to be found in classical prose, are in the correspond-
ence of Cicero,³ and twelve of the fourteen cases of the last-
mentioned construction, which is the more colloquial of the
tw0, occur in letters to Cicero's most familiar correspond-
ents, eg. ‘tu, malum,’ inquies, ‘actum ne agas’ (Aer. 9. 18. 3);
circum aretem illius de sua egestate ne sis aspernatus (Q. fr.
2. ιο (12). 5).

(c) The so-called epistolacy uscos tlrc tenses is the com·
monest peculiarity in the use of tenses to be found in
the Letters. The writer of the letter imagines himself in
the place of the recipient, and therefore usesa tense of past
time in speaking of an event which was exactly or approxi-
mately contemporaneous with the writijng of the letter.
This usage-is most frequent with verbs indicating the writ-
ing of a letter, or the sending of a letter or messenger,⁴ as
egotibi aliquid de meis scriptis mittam: crilcil crat absoluti
(Art. 1. 16. 18); quaemihi cernebant in merstem, qrcacad tc
pertinere arbitrabar, qued in Ciliciam proficiscebar, existimavi
me ad ‘tc oportere scribere (Fam. 2. 18. 3). Cf. also note to
profecti sumus, Epist. XI. 3.

habere with the perfect participle passive, but if a few cases
