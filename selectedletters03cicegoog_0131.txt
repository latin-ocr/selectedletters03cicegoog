48 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. X.

strae consanguineus non mediocres terrores iacit atque
denuntiat, ct Sampsiceramo negat, ceteris prae se fert
et ostentat. Quamobrem, si me amas tantum quantum
proiecto amas, si dormis, expergiscere, si stas, ingre-
dere, si ingrederis, curre, si curris, advola. Credibile
non est quantum ego in consiliis et prudentia tua, quod-
que maximum est, quantum in amore et fide ponam.
Magnitudo rei longam orationem fortasse desiderat,
coniunctio vero nostrorum animorum brevitate con-
tenta est. Permagni nostra interest te, si comitiis non
potueris, at declarato illo esse Romae. Cura ut valeas

Clodia had at one time hoped to
attract Cicero by her charms, and
her hatred of him was partly due
to the failure ol her efforts-si
comitiis (esse Romae) non potue·
ris: the electioris were to take place
Oct. 18 (cl. Art. 2. 20. 6), but the

Cicero's urgent requests for the
presence oi Atticus would seem

is a break in the correspondence
between the two men from No·

which time Atticus was doubtless
in Rome.

The correspondence ol the year
59 nc. reveals the utter helpless·
ness of the senatorial party to cope
with the triumvirs. The former
werewithouta‘platform’andwith·

out leaders. The petulant oppo-
sition of Bibulus and the tact-
less obstinacyof Cato excited only
ridicule and anger. These letters
as awhole disclose also Cicero’s
lack ol political insight in failing
utterly to appreciate the strength
of the Triumuirate, and in failing
to see up to the last moment the
danger of his own position (cl.
also lntr. 14). In striking contrast
to the letters of this year are those
written six months later.

X. Vibo, about April 12, 58 uc.
The letters of this third book,
ad Att, written in exile, expose
perhaps more than any other por·
tion of his correspondence, the
weak side of Cicero’s character.
He is unmanly, selfish, and un-
gratelul. In contrast the letters
ol 44 and 43 uc. breathe a spirit
ol unlailing courage and unselfish
