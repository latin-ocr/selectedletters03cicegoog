alter his death (3² ιω).1 Some of the men of note upon
whom Cicero had expressed unfavorable opinions were still
living in 3² uc, and the publication of these letters would
therefore have been indiscreet. The books in the collection
ud Au. stand in chronological order, and the letters within
’ the books are arranged chronologically, but not with
accuracy.

With the Epistulae ad Quintum fratrem may be mentioned
the Commentariolum Petr'tiuru's,² a document which Quintus
sent to his brother when the latter was a candidate lor the
consulship. The letters proper, as well as the Epistulae ad
M. Brutum, were edited by Τίῐο.8 There were originally
nine books ol the letters to Brutus, but seven ot them have
been lost. Those which remain are probably Bks. 9 and8
of the original collection. The authenticity ot the Epist.
ad M. Brut. has been seriously doubted, but, with the
exception perhaps ol 1. 16 and 17,⁴ they are now commonly
regarded as authentic.

year 1389, however, Coluccio Salutato, the Florentine chan-
cellor, obtained from Vercelli a copy of a Ciceronian manu-
script, which was found to contain the Epist. ad Fam.⁶ This
manuscript and the copy secured by Coluccio are now in the
Laurentian, Library at Florence. The former belongs to the
