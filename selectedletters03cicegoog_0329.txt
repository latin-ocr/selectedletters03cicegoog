This military evolution, which con-
sisted in parading on either side
of Caesar, was intended as a com·
pliment to Dolabella. — Nicia:
a common friend of Cicero and
Dolabella.

The excitement which this visit
produced is reflected in the lan·
guage of the letter, which in the
great number of ellipses and of
Greek expressions presents a fine
specimen of the sermo familiaris
(Hofmann). lt is a significant fact
that Caesar was assassinated

splectaclekwhich Caesar prtehsemed
w en ma rn a progress rou
Italy attended by a disordefiy
bodyguard of 2000 men, may well
have crystallized the sentiment
forming against him.

LXXXIV. Rome, about Jan.
r, 44 rac. Acilius, to whom Fam.
13. 30-39 also were addressed, had
been twice successfully defended
by Cicero (Fam. 7. 30. 3). He
had just been sent out to Achaia
to succeed Servius Sulpicius Ru·
fus (cf. Fam. 7. ²9· r; 7. 30. 3).
For M'. Curius, in whose behalf
the letter was written, see Ep.
XXXIX. 2. Cicero felt a debt
of gratitude to him, because of
the hospitality which he had
shown him at Patrae, after the
battle of Pharsalus (cf. Fam. 13.
17. ι). The letter was written in
response to a request from Curius
(cf. Fam. 7. 29.1; 7. 30. 3).
