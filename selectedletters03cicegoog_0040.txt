INTRODUCTION. ⁴ xxxiii

The Pompeians, after planning a rendezvous at Luceria,¹
hurried toward Brundisium, whither Pompey peremptorily
summoned Cicero.² Nevertheless he remained in For-
miae, hoping still to effect a reconciliation between Caesar
and Pompey,³ and, with this hope in mind, he had an
interview with Caesar at Formiae‚⁴ Mar. 28. In this inter·
view Caesar requested him to go to Rome and use his
best efforts to secure peace, but when Cicero mentioned
- the terms which he should propose, Caesar refusedto
accept them.

30. This meeting put an end to his hesitation. He felt

sure that all hope ot a reconciliation was gone, as neither ’

party would submit terms which the other could accept.
Cicero has been often accused of indecision during this
period, but unjustly so, In his opinion there was right and
wrong with each party, and civil war was an evil to be
avoided at all hazards. He used every possible means,
therefore, to avert the catastrophe, but without success.
Recognizing the inevitable, he cast in his lot with theman
to whom he personally owed most ; for the choice lay, not
. between Caesar and the Republic, but between Caesar and
Pompey3 nee mehercule hoc facio rei publicae causa, quam
fundatus deletam puto, sed ne quis me putet ingratum in eum ,
qui me levavit iis incommodis (ie. of exile) quibus idem
afficeratffltt. 9. 19. 2).

31. On June 7, 49 nc, Cicem, accompanied by his
brother, his son, and his nephew, sailed from Formiae to ·
join Pompey near Dyrrachium,³ which place he reached,
after stopping tor several months on the estate of Atticus
