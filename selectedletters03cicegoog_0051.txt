47. ln his financial dealings Cicero was honorable and
high-minded. He declined to make money, as even his
friends Atticus and M. Brutus did, by loaning money at
usurious rates. His upright management of Cilicia was in
marked contrast to the almost universal practices olbis
contemporaries. He paid his debts conscientiously, although

these facts that the code of honor in such matters was not
so strict in Cicero's day as it is in our own, and that

Still he was not a man ot profound learning, even in his
chosen profession. He was rather a man ot cultivated tastes
and broad sympathies. Ol his knowledge ol the literature,
history, and antiquities of Greece and Rome, his letters,
