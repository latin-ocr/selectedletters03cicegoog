The extant collections coutain about 870 letters, ol which
4²3 are included in the Bks. ad Fam., 394 in the Bks. ad
Aer, and the remainder is divided almost equally between
the other two collections. The correspondence contains 98
letters from 31 other persons than Cicero. Seventy-three of
these letters are found in the Bks. ad Fam.

⁶⁶. The collection oi letters acl Fam. seems to be made up
oi three parts¹: (i) Bk. 13, (ii) Bks. 1—9 and 14-16, (iii) Bks.
ro-ra. The letters of Bk. 13 are all letters oi recommenda-
tion‚ and were probably collected and perhaps published in
the summer ol 44 ae. Ol the other books, 1-9 and
14-16 contain epistles‚ other than letters oi recommendation‚
written belore the summer oi 44 ss.c.; and Bks. 10-12 con-
tain letters written later than that date. The date of
publication ol parts ii and iii is not known. In view of the
criticisms made upon Antony in some ol these letters,¹ per-
haps they were not published until aiter the battle ol Actium,
or still later.² The title Epistulae ad Familiares is modern.

Tiro, Cicero's secretary‚ was making a collection ol Cicero’s
letters in 44 acl The collection ol letters ad Fam. contains
no letters from Tiro, but many addressed to him, even by
other people than Cicero. He is therefore almost certainly
the editor oi this collection. '

67. The collection ad Atticum contains no letter from
Atticus. This state oi things, together with the well-known
fact that Atticus was a publisher, and that Cornelius Nepos
says⁴ that such a collection ol Cicero's letters, not yet
published, was in the possession oi Atticus, makes it almost
certain that these letters were arranged for publication by
him, It is probable that they were not published until
