2 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. 1.

hoc percrebrescit, plurimos nostros amicos inveniri.
Nos autem initium prensandi facere cogitaramus eo
ipso tempore quo tuum puerum cum his litteris profi· '
cisci Cincius dicebat, in campo 'comitiis tribuniciis
a. d. xvi Kalend. Sextiles. Competitores, qui certi
esse videantur, Galba et Antonius et Q. Cornificius —
puto te in hoc aut risisse aut ingemuisse; ut frontem
ferias, sunt qui etiam Caesonium putent. Aquilium
uon arbitramur, qui denegat et iuravit morbum et illud
suum regnum iudiciale opposuit; Catilina, si iudicatum
erit meridie non lucere, certus erit competit0r; de
Aufidio et de Palicano non puto te exspectare dum

will not take place before July, 64

of a patriot. — frontem ferias: cf. -

epistolary tenseS, representing re-
spectively the perfect and present 3
cf. Intr. 84 c. The statement is put
in the form in which the facts would
present themselvestodtticns when

' the letter should be received.—
· puerum, servant; referring to the

tabellarius (see Intr. 64). -cin-
cius: one of the agents (procura-
tores) ot Atticus—ad. xvi Ka-
lend. Sextiles: this was not the
formal announcement (professio)
on Cicero’s part of his intention
of standing for the consulship, as
the latter would be made on the
day on which notice of the electiori
was given, ie. three nundinae. or
17 days, before the day of the
electiori. Cf. Herzog, 1. p. 656,
1092, n. 2.-Antonius: Cicero’s
colleague in 63 inc—Q. Corni-
ficius: the father of the orator
and politician Q. Comificius‚ to
whom Fam. 12. 17-30 are ad-
dressed.-risisse aut ingemu-
isse: on hearing that such no·
. bodies aspire to the consulship.
The situation, while humorous‚ is
also one to excite the indignation

mi, mulla corporis, frons nom per-
cussa, nonsemur. Cicero speaks
of Caesonius in a very different
way in Verr. i. 29 homo in rebus
iudicandis spectatus et cognitus. -
Aquilium: sc. competitorem fore.
C.AquiliusGalluswaspraetorwith
Cicero in 66 ric-iuravit mor·
bum: the simple acc. after iurare
is rare. The phrase is probably a
legal one; cf. Fam. 8. 8. 3 cum
calumniam iurasset. lurore mor·
bum means ‘to take an oath that
one is ill ' as an excuse for the non·
performance of some duty. — reg-
num iudiciale: Aquilius was a
well-known jurist (pro Caec. 77),
too much occupied with legal
business to engage in politics. Cf.
regno forensi, Ep. LXII. 1.-iu·
dicatum erit: in the approaching
trial of Catiline for misappropria·
tion of public funds. The accuser
was Cicero's subsequent enemy
Clodius—Aufidio: aformer prae·
tor in Asia (cf. pro Macco, 4 5).-
Palicano: a tribune in 71 uc.
