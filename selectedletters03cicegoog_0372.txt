“ CRlTlCAL APPENDIX.

*ffb*-

IN this Appendix many oi the most important variations in the text
of this edition from that oi the Medicean codices (M. 49, 9and 49, 18)
are indicated, and the most probable conjectures for sdme of the doubt-
ful passages are presented. The source of many of these conjectures
has not been indicated on account of the difficulty of tracing them to
their authors. Mere orthographical variations have not been noted.
For the benerit of those who may wish to make a more careful study
of a portion ot the text, the critical notes have been made somewhat
fuller for the first sorry-three letters than for the rest. A complete
apparatus criticus oi the Epistulae ad familiares may be found in Men·
delssohn’s edition. The adnotatio critica of C. F. W. Miiller con·
tains critical notes on the Epistulae ad Quintum fratrem. For the
Epistulae ad Atticum the student may be referred to the editions of
Orelli, Baiter and Kayser, Wesenberg, and Tyrrell. These editions con·
tain critical notes on the other letters of Cicero also. The other prin·
cipal sources of information are C. A. Lehmann, Quaestiones Tullianae,
and De Ciceronis ad Atticum epistulis recensendis et emendandis, Th.
Schiche, Zu Ciceros Briesen an Atticus, P. Starker, Symbolae Criticae ad
M. Tullii Ciceronis epistulas, 0. Streicher, De Ciceronis epistolis ad
