characteristica oi colloquial language is its fondness for the
picturesque. This is secured mainly by the use oi meta-
phors. One of the commonest figures employed in the
Letters is that drawn from heat and cold,—the former
indicating activity, the latter inertia: e.g. illi rumores de
comitiis Transpadanorum Cumarum tenus caluerunt (Cael,
Fam.8. 1. 2); cum Romae a iudiciis sorum refrixerit (Ast.
1. 1. 2); scripsi Curionem valde frigere, iam calet (Cael,
Fam. 8. 6. 5). CommercIal legal, and popular expressions,
in a figurative sense, also occur in great variety. CI. also
notes to quas ego pugnas ct quantas strages edidi, Epist. V. 1,
and malitiaam, Epist. IX. 2.

100. Polite Plarasa. Such polite phrases as si me amas
(e.g. Vatia, Fam, 5. 9. 1), amabo tc (e.g. Cael, Fam. 8. 6. 5),
and such terms oi endearment as mel ac deliciae tuae (Cael,
Fam. 8. 8. ι), are naturally of frequent occurrence. Appar-
ently the Plautiae sis (siais) and sodes are not used. C I.
also notes to nostri amares, Epist. VII. 2, si meamus, Epist.
XIII. 3, and molestum, Epist. XVIII. 10.

101. Pleanasm. While aiming at brevigy in some caseS,
in others familiar speech indulges itself in duplicative or
pleonastic expressions for the sake of emphasis or distinct-
ness‚ in much the same way as it employs extravagant
language. Instances from the Letters are rursus reducere
(Balbus Att. 8. 15a. 1) ; malle patius (Cato, Fam. 15. 5. 2);
nostra iudicia . . . existimamus (Balbus and OppiuS, Att.
9. ya. 1), ostentare crebro (Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2). On
‘double expressions,' cf. note to ora obsecro, Epist. L. 1.

102. Papular aad Proverbsal Expressions. The informal
character oi the Letters is shown, not so much by the fro
quent use oi these expressions, although their number in
the aggregate is large, as by the fact that they are unac-
companied by any such apologetic phrase as ut aiunt,
