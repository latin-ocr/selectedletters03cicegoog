not to go to Asia, and had proba·
bly based his refusal upon' his

tes, the equestrian order regarded
the investigation as a covert attack

well-known policy of keeping out
of politics (cf. Ep. V. 14). These
facts would absolve Atticus from
the charge oi cherishing any ill-
will toward Quintus. —et illa. . .
et haec nostra: the letter up to
this point consists of two distinet
parts; in the first part (1-4) the
relations existing between Atticus
and Quintus are discussed, in the
second part (5-7) the relations
between Atticus and Marcus Cic-
ero. A third division of the letter,
devoted to politics, begins with 8.

8. ob iudicandum: this sena-
, torial investigation was directed
particularly against the jury in the
Clodian trial, the majority oi
which was supposed to have been
bribed (ci. Ep. V. 5). Cato, who
proposed the investigation (cf. Att.
2. r. 8), was acting simply in the
interests of justice3 but, as many
of the suspected jurors were equa'

upon themselves, which at the
same time they could not oppose
(neque aperte dicere) without
appearing to defend crime. The
incident offers an excellent oppor-
tunity to contrast the methods of
Cato and of the politica] group to
which he belonged, with those of
Cicero and his school. Cato wishes
to punish the offenders regardless
of the political consequences, or,
as Cicero puts it (Aa. 2. r. 8), dicit
.. . tamquam in Platonis πολιτείᾳ,
nan tamquam in Romuli faece sen-
tentiam. Cicero abhors the deed,
but does not wish to punish the
evil-doers, for tear of alienating
the class to which they belonged,
and thus weakening the opposition
to the democracy. Cf. Aa. 2. r.8
(end). Cato premium-accepis-
