CICERO ATTICO SAL

L. Iulio Caesare C. Marcio Figulo consulibus filiolo t

famia (Tyrrell). - ἐπεὶ οὐχ ἱερήϊον
οὐδὲ fierine: Il. XXII. 159· The
meaning is ‘since it is no small
prize Ι light for!

5. Hermathena: a double·
faced statue or bu'st, similar to
those found in excavations t0·day.
One face was that of Hermes, the
other that of Athena-ut totum
gymnasium . .. videatur: this
is the MS. reading, but is scarcely
intelligible; perhaps it means, ‘so
that the whole gymnasium seems
to be an offering to it' (Watson).
-multum te amamus: a collo-
quial expression of gratitude.

ll. Rome, the latter part of 6 5
uc. The historica] value of this
letter springs from the fact that it
fixes the date of the birth of Cice-
ro's son (6 5 ao), that it contains
the main point in the evidence with
reference to‘ Cicero’s defense of
Catiline against the charge of mis·
appropriation of public money, and
accounts for the absence of letters
between Cicero and Atticus from

64-62 tte. inclusive (cf. last sen·
tence).

ι. L. lulio Caesare C. Marcio
Figulo consulibus: the natural
meaning would be, ‘in the con-
sulship of,‘ etc, and would make
64 uc. the date of this letter, but
the reference t0 the approaching
trial of Catiline proves that it
must have been written in 65 tte,

after the election of the new con· ι

suls, as the trial was begun and fin-
ished in that year. The brevity and
apparent lack of feeling in Cicero's
announcement to his most inti-
mate friend of the birth of his
son has called forth severe criti·
cisms from his enemies, and apolo-
gies from iris friends (cf. Abeken,
pp. 33, 34) — quite without reason.
Both parties have failed to see the
gay humor of the passage which
couples this important event in his
family life with the most important
aventin the political world. For
an account of the new consuls, cf.
Ep. l.—filiolo: for an account
