Optimates. Through the lavorable action oi the pantfices,
Cicero had recovered his building site on the Palatine and ι
damages ior the loss oi his house and villas. The unani-
mous acquittal, in Man, 56 nc, oi P. Sestius, Cicero's
foremost champion in 57 nc„ who was prosecutcd ona
charge de arabim et de vi, was a decided triumph ior Cicero
and the Bani¹ Furthermore, there, was a lack of harmony
in the party oi the triumvirs. Emboldened by this state of
