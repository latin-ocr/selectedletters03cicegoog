CICERO ATTICO SAL.

ἵ sci0, huiusmodi ratio est, quod adhuc coniectura pro-
videri possit. Prensat unus¹ P. Galba: sine fuco ac
fallaciis more maiorum negatur. Vt opinio est honrin
num, non aliena rationi nostrae fuit illius haec prae-
propera prensatio; nam illi ita negant vulgo ut mihi

I. Rome, July, 65 ΒΩ. The
tenth letter oi the extant correspon-
dence; the earlier letters being
Art. 1. 5, 6, 7 (68 s.c.); 9, 8, ro,
11 (67 s.c.); 3, 4 (66 nc). The
letter is interesting ior the light
which it throws in general upon
methods of electioneering at
Rome, and in particular upon
Cicero's political plans and pros-
pects a year before the elections
at which he intended to be a can·
didate for the consulship. On the
elections, ci. also Herzog, l. pp.
654-661.

alone is making an open canvass' ς
probably with reference to the
practice of personally seeking
votes or winning friends by shak-
ing hands with, and talking with,
voters in the Forum and other
public places. —unusz Antonius
and Cornificius have not yet begun
an active canvass, although their
intentioris are known. On P. Sul-
picius Galba, cf. Verr. i. 30⁴.—
