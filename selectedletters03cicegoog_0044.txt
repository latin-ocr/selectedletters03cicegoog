36. Soon after the murder of Caesar, the assassins, or
the liberatores, as they were termed by Cicero, distrusting
the temper of the people, withdrew to the Capitol,² which
was guarded by the gladiators of D. Brutus Here they
were visited in the evening by a number of prominent men,
among them being Cicero. He himself had had no part in
the formation oi the plot which led to Caesar's assassination
or in its execution,⁸ but his satisfaction at the removal ol
Caesar is plainly shown in a'jubilant letter⁴ written to
L. Basilus, one of the conspirators, probably on the day
of the assassination.

consulship, gained possession of all his private treasure and
political paper5,⁵ but thought it wisc to leave the adjustment
of affairs. to the senate.⁶ The senate met Mar. 17, and
adopted Cicero’s proposal to ratify Caesar's acts and to
grant amnesty to the conspirators.⁷ At the same time
